/**
 * Footer status key registry for pi-astack extensions.
 *
 * pi renders extension statuses in the footer sorted by key
 * (localeCompare, ascending) — see
 * pi-coding-agent/dist/modes/interactive/components/footer.js. There is
 * no priority parameter on `ctx.ui.setStatus()`, so display order is
 * fully determined by the key string.
 *
 * Convention: `NN-<extension-name>` where NN is a zero-padded 2-digit
 * prefix. We pad to 2 digits and leave gaps (01 / 02 / 03 rather than
 * 1 / 2 / 3) so a new extension can slot between siblings without
 * renumbering. String-sort keeps `01a-foo` < `02-bar`, etc.
 *
 * Display order rationale — follows the event timeline so the footer
 * reads left-to-right as "environment → turn → end-of-turn":
 *
 *   01  model-curator  environment readiness (which models are usable
 *                      in this session). Set once at session_start.
 *
 *   02  dispatch       main-session tool lifecycle (idle/running/
 *                      completed/failed). Updated per dispatch_*
 *                      tool call.
 *
 *   03  sediment       agent_end background extraction status. Updated
 *                      per turn after the LLM returns.
 *
 * To add a new extension:
 *   1. Pick an unused 2-digit prefix that fits the timeline.
 *   2. Add an entry here so the registry stays the single source of
 *      truth — never hardcode a `setStatus(...)` key in the extension.
