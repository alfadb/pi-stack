/**
 * Ensure `<abrainHome>/.gitignore` contains a `.state/` line.
 *
 * P1-C audit fix 2026-05-16 (round 3 gpt-5.5): previously the `.state/`
 * gitignore line was only appended when `/abrain bind` ran
 * (`_shared/runtime.ts::bindAbrainProject`). If a user had a git-inited
 * `~/.abrain` but never bound a project, Lane G `route_rejected` orphan
 * samples would land in `.state/sediment/orphan-rejects/<file>.md`
 * (containing sanitized user title/body) and `git add .` could carry
 * them to the abrain remote.
 *
 * Now invoked from abrain `activate()` (after `ensureBrainLayout`) so the
 * gitignore guard exists before any writer can fire.
 *
 * Idempotent: only writes when the line is missing.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - { updated: false } if the line is already present. (If `abrainHome`
 *     doesn't exist yet the underlying `writeFileSync` would ENOENT —
 *     caller is expected to ensure the directory first, typically via
 *     `ensureBrainLayout()`.)
 *   - { updated: true, path } when the line was just appended.
 *
 * P2-A audit fix 2026-05-16 (round 4 opus-4-7): write is now ATOMIC
 * (tmp + rename) instead of bare writeFileSync. `.gitignore` is the
 * single guard preventing `.state/` (vault-events.jsonl, sediment
 * audit.jsonl, orphan-rejects samples) from being `git add .`ed into
 * the abrain remote. A crash mid-write previously could leave a 0-byte
 * .gitignore, invalidating the guard until next boot.
