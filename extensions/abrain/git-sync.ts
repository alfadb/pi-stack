/**
 * Abrain auto-sync to remote (ADR 0020, revised 2026-05-17).
 *
 * Provides four operations against the `~/.abrain` git repo:
 *
 *   - pushAsync()    fire-and-forget after sediment commits; single-flight locked
 *   - fetchAndFF()   pi startup fetch + fast-forward; auto-merges (git 3-way,
 *                    no LLM) on divergence; only textual conflicts surface a
 *                    runbook. NEVER rebases (would rewrite local SHAs).
 *   - sync()         /abrain sync slash command: fetch+ff/merge+push in one call
 *   - getStatus()    /abrain status: ahead/behind/last-sync/last-error
 *
 * Design principles (per ADR 0020 + 2026-05-17 revision):
 *
 *   1. ALL git ops are silent-by-default. Failures write to
 *      ~/.abrain/.state/git-sync.jsonl (audit) and never throw to caller.
 *      Sediment's commit path must NEVER be blocked by network/auth issues.
 *
 *   2. Divergence is auto-resolved via `git merge --no-edit --no-ff` (3-way
 *      text merge — same algorithm git uses for code; no LLM in the loop).
 *      A textual conflict (unmerged paths) aborts with `merge --abort`,
 *      restores the working tree, and surfaces a runbook naming the
 *      conflicting files. We NEVER rebase (would silently rewrite local
 *      SHAs) and NEVER LLM-merge (hallucination risk in knowledge body
 *      text). Merge subprocess uses a hard env override for author/
 *      committer identity and disables commit signing so a user's
 *      `commit.gpgsign=true` config can't make merges fail at GPG
 *      pinentry. Working-tree-clean preflight runs before the merge so a
 *      dirty tree is reported as `failed` rather than misclassified as
 *      a conflict by the merge subprocess's overwrite-refusal.
 *
 *   3. No git ops when there's no `origin` remote — silently skipped.
 *      This keeps users who run abrain locally without a remote unaffected.
 *
 *   4. Single-flight in-process: concurrent sediment commits in the SAME
 *      pi process would race on git's index lock; we serialize via an
 *      in-memory promise singleton. Cross-process protection (multiple pi
 *      instances) relies on git's own .git/index.lock — that's the
 *      fail-soft path (one wins, others audit-log a failed result).
 *      KNOWN GAP (2026-05-17, tracked as ADR 0020 followup): sediment's
 *      own `gitCommit()` in writer.ts does NOT route through this
 *      singleFlight, so it can still race the new auto-merge step on
 *      `.git/index.lock`. The current mitigation is the result-taxonomy
 *      fix (catch block correctly labels lock contention as `failed`
 *      rather than `conflict`); a structural fix requires exporting
 *      `singleFlight` and wiring sediment through it.
 *
 *   5. Argv contains zero secrets. We only pass branch names and standard
 *      git verbs; credentials come from the system git credential helper
 *      (typically ~/.git-credentials or SSH agent). This matches the
 *      vault.ts pattern: never inject plaintext via argv.

 * strings; the regex is now correct under all user locales.

// Unable to create '.git/index.lock'" and we'd audit it as a spurious

// Round 2 audit fix (gpt #2 TOCTOU): the previous implementation used a
// single `inflightOp` slot with `if (inflightOp) await inflightOp`. With
// 3+ concurrent callers, two/three of them all awaited the same prior

// contention we wanted to prevent (smoke test #13 happened to pass only
// because it tested 2 concurrent callers against a fast local-bare push;
// 3+ on a slower network would have exposed the race).

// onto `tail.then(fn, fn)` so it runs strictly after every prior fn settles
// (we pass fn as BOTH onFulfilled and onRejected so a prior rejection
// doesn't block the next caller). `tail` is advanced to a swallowed copy
